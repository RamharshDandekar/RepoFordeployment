                <h4>Linear Search Algorithm</h4>
                <p>Learn about Linear Search, a straightforward algorithm for finding a target value within a list. It checks each element until it finds the target, making it simple but not as efficient as other methods for large datasets. This method is foundational for understanding more complex searching algorithms.</p>
