            (b) The Company offers a 100% money-back guarantee on its Readymade Music Literacy program. You may qualify for the 100%
            guarantee if you (i) have completed all 36 lessons, (ii) can provide substantial documentation that you have completed

        <p class="heading">Payments</p>
        <p>
            Amounts due from you may be paid by authorized credit card (your “Card”). The Company uses a third party credit card
            processor to process the fees owed by you. You agree that the credit card processor, and not the Company, will be
            responsible for any errors by the credit card processor in processing fees. When you provide your Card information, you
            represent and warrant that you are permitted to use the Card and that all Card information and billing information is
            current, correct, and complete. If you have any question about a charge on your Card, provide written notice to the
            Company. You agree that you will not exercise and unconditionally waive any chargeback rights you may have by use of
            your Card. If you deliberately or inadvertently issue a chargeback to your credit card, your account will be terminated
            and you agree to pay the Company’s standard processing and collection fee. Amounts due from you may be paid by cash,
            check, and/or purchase order (“Other”). You agree to pay The Company within 30 days of receiving your invoice.

            companies. Your use of such web pages or websites, while subject to the terms of this Agreement, is also subject to and
            governed by the terms and guidelines, if any, contained within such web page or website. The Company does not endorse,
            and takes no responsibility for such products, services, websites, and materials. The Company is not responsible for and

        </p>

        <p class="heading">General Terms</p>
        <p>
            (a) This Agreement shall not be construed as creating any agency, partnership or joint venture between you and the
            Company.
            
            (b) This Agreement, all intellectual property issues, and your rights and obligations are governed by the laws of the
            United States of America and the State of Arizona, without regarding conflicts of law provisions. If you are accessing
            the Site or Services from a physical location outside of the United States with laws or regulations governing personal
            data collection, use, and disclosure that are different from the United States laws, you agree that by accessing the
            Site or Services you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to the application
            of the laws of the United States and the State of Arizona with respect to use of the Site or Services and any dispute
            regarding the Site, Services or this Agreement. You agree that any action to enforce these terms and conditions or in
            any manner related to the Company will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Collin County,
            Texas and you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts. You and the Company hereby expressly waive any rights
            to contest the jurisdiction, venue or convenience of any such federal or state court located in Collin County, Texas.
            The prevailing party in any litigation shall be entitled to recover from the other party its reasonable attorneys’ fees
            (as determined by a court and not a jury) and related costs and expenses incurred as a result of the litigation in
            addition to such other relief as may be granted.
            
            (c) This Agreement and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company with respect to
            the use of the Site and the Services. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional
            terms and conditions posted on the Site, the terms will be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible,
            and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions will control. The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed
            severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the
            other provision hereof. Any provision determined to be invalid or unenforceable will be modified, to the extent
            possible, to be valid and enforceable so as to retain the intent of the parties. The failure by either party to exercise
            or enforce any rights or provisions of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The
            section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The parties agree
            that the indemnification provisions, and all such similar terms which, by their substantive intent are intended to
            survive termination of this Agreement, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
            
            (d) You shall not assign or transfer, or purport to assign or transfer, any of your rights or obligations under this
            Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding
            upon and shall inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the respective parties hereto.
            
            (e) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all notices to the Company shall be sent by email to legal (at)
            readymademusic.net. Any notices sent by the Company to you shall be sent to the email address. Notice shall be deemed
            given twenty-four (24) hours after an electronic message is sent, unless the sending party is notified that the message
            did not reach the recipient or three (3) days after the date of mailing.
