                it is necessary for completing the transactions you have authorized including, but not limited to, providing such

            <p>
                We collect various kinds of information that you provide to us as well as information we obtain from your use of the
                services. Some of the types of information that we collect include:
                
                “Personal Information”—information associated with or used to identify or contact a specific person. Personal
                Information includes: (1) contact data (such as e-mail address, address and telephone number) and (2) certain Usage Data
                (defined below), such as IP address.
                
                “Usage Data”—information about an individual's online activity that, by itself, does not identify the individual, such
                as technical information, including your browser type, service provider, IP address, operating system and webpages
                visited.
                
                (Generally, we do not consider Usage Data as Personal Information because Usage Data by itself usually does not identify
                an individual. Personal Information and Usage Data may be linked together. Different types of Usage Data also may be
                linked together and, once linked, may identify an individual person. Some Usage Data may be Personal Information under
                applicable law.)
                
                “Location Data” is a category of Personal Information collected about the location of a mobile device or computer,
                including: the location of the mobile device or computer used to access the services derived from GPS or WiFi use; or
                the IP address of the mobile device or computer or internet service used to access the Services.
